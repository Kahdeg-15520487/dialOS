- **Task Ownership**: Files owned by tasks for isolation
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Buffers grow as needed (doubling strategy)
- **Concurrent Access**: 8 file handles, 16 max files
- **Statistics**: Storage usage and file count reporting

#### 6. Custom Hardware Drivers ✅
- **PCNT Encoder Driver**: Hardware-accelerated rotary encoder using ESP32 PCNT peripheral
  - Quadrature decoding on GPIO40/41
  - Pulse counting with filtering
  - Pull-up resistors enabled

#### 7. Hardware Integration ✅
- **M5Dial Platform**: Fully initialized with M5Dial library
- **Display**: 240x240px circular TFT working
- **Touch**: FT3267 touch controller ready
- **Encoder**: Custom PCNT driver integrated
- **Build System**: PlatformIO with espressif32 platform

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Kernel initialization
- ✅ Task creation and scheduling
- ✅ Memory allocation and isolation
- ✅ System logging
- ✅ Custom encoder driver
- ✅ RamFS file operations (create, write, read)
- ✅ RamFS statistics

### Lessons Learned
1. **Arduino Macro Conflicts**: Arduino framework defines HIGH and LOW as macros, requiring enum values to be renamed (HIGH_PRIORITY, LOW_PRIORITY)
2. **Forward Declarations**: Used extensively to avoid circular dependencies between kernel components
3. **Global Function Conflicts**: Used `::free()` to explicitly call global free function vs RamFS member
4. **Task Ownership**: Clean isolation model with task-based memory and file ownership

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- [ ] Create HAL interface for M5Dial peripherals
- [ ] Abstract display operations
- [ ] Abstract touch input
- [ ] Abstract encoder input
- [ ] Abstract RFID reader
- [ ] Abstract buzzer control

### Phase 4: I2C Storage & Discovery
- [ ] Implement I2C bus scanner
- [ ] Create device detection protocol
- [ ] Hot-plug device management

## Known Issues
- None currently - all builds passing ✅

## Development Environment
- **Platform**: PlatformIO
- **Framework**: Arduino (espressif32)
- **Board**: M5Stack StampS3 (ESP32-S3)
- **Library**: M5Dial@^1.0.3
- **Build Tool**: platformio run -e m5stack-stamps3

## Architecture Decisions

### Why RamFS First?
RamFS provides a foundation for the file system architecture without the complexity of I2C hardware. It allows testing of:
- File ownership model
- API design
- Integration patterns
- Memory management strategies

The same APIs will extend to I2C-based storage through the VFS layer.

### Why Cooperative Scheduling?
- Simpler implementation for embedded systems
- Lower memory overhead than preemptive scheduling
- Sufficient for UI-focused applications
- Apps can yield voluntarily for better resource sharing

### Why Custom Bytecode vs WASM?
- Lower memory footprint
- Full control over execution model
- Easier to implement security boundaries
- Can upgrade to WASM later if needed

### Why Task-based Ownership?
- Clean isolation between apps
- Easy cleanup when app terminates
- Security through separation
- Simple programming model

## Performance Targets
- [ ] Display updates: 60 FPS
- [ ] Encoder response: < 10ms latency
- [ ] App startup: < 500ms
- [ ] File operations: < 1ms for RamFS
- [ ] Task switch: < 100μs

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Each kernel component tested independently
2. **Integration Testing**: Component interactions verified
3. **System Testing**: Full OS functionality on hardware
4. **Stress Testing**: Multiple apps, memory pressure, I2C hot-plug
5. **Performance Testing**: Measure against targets above
